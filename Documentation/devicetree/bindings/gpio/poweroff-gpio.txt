GPIO line that should be set high/low to power off a device

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "gpio-poweroff".
- gpios : The GPIO to set high/low, see "gpios property" in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt. If the pin should be
  low to power down the board set it to "Active Low", otherwise set
  gpio to "Active High".

Examples:

gpio-poweroff {
	compatible = "gpio-poweroff";
	gpios = <&gpio 4 0>; /* GPIO 4 Active High */
};
